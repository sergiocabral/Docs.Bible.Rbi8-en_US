[[v9-6-3]]

^<<v9-6-3,3>>^ To this they said: “If YOU are sending the ark of the God of Israel away, do not send it away without an offering, for YOU should by all means return to him a guilt offering.

[NOTE]

^<<v9-6-9,9>>^ And YOU must look: if it is the road to its territory that it goes up, to Beth-sheʹmesh, it is he that has done to us this great evil; but if not, we must know that it was not his hand that touched us; an accident it was that happened to us.”

All the while the axis lords of the Phi·lisʹtines were walking after them as far as the boundary of Beth-sheʹmesh.

[NOTE]
====
. Lit., “began to be straight.”
. “Lowing as they went.” In Heb. these are two verbs in the infinitive absolute, indefinite as to time and impersonal.
====

[[v9-6-13]]

^<<v9-6-13,13>>^ And people of Beth-sheʹmesh were reaping the wheat harvest in the low plain. When they raised their eyes and saw the Ark, they gave way to rejoicing at seeing it.

[[v9-6-14]]

^<<v9-6-14,14>>^ And the wagon itself came into the field of Joshua the Beth-sheʹmite and kept standing there, where there was a large stone. And they went splitting up the wood of the wagon, and the cows they offered up as a burnt offering to Jehovah.

[[v9-6-15]]

^<<v9-6-15,15>>^ And the Levites themselves took the ark of Jehovah down and the box that was with it, in which the golden articles were, and they proceeded to put it upon the large stone.

[[v9-6-18]]

^<<v9-6-18,18>>^ And the golden jerboas were to the number of all the cities of the Phi·lisʹtines belonging to the five axis lords, from the fortified city to the village of the open country.
And the great stone^&#42;1^ upon which they rested the ark of Jehovah is a witness^&#42;2^ down to this day in the field of Joshua the Beth-sheʹmite.

[NOTE]
====
. “The great stone,” TLXX and three Heb. mss; SyVg, “Abel the Great,” to agree with M, which has ʼA·velʹ, “Abel,” instead of ʼeʹven, “stone.”
. “A witness,” or, “still (yet),” by different vowel pointings; M, “as far as.”
====

[[v9-6-19]]

^<<v9-6-19,19>>^ And he went striking down the men of Beth-sheʹmesh,^&#42;1^ because they had looked upon the ark of Jehovah. So he struck down among the people seventy men—fifty thousand men^&#42;2^—and the people began mourning because Jehovah had struck down the people with a great slaughter.

[NOTE]
====
. “And he went striking down the men of Beth-shemesh,” M(Sy)Vg; LXX, “And the sons of Jechoniah were not pleased with the men of Beth-shemesh,” or, “And among the men of Beth-shemesh the sons of Jechoniah did not receive [it] gladly.”
. “Seventy men​—⁠fifty thousand men.” In M “fifty thousand men” is not connected with “seventy men” by the conjunction waw, “and,” as is the case with numbers elsewhere, as in Nu 1:21-46. This might suggest that “fifty thousand men” is an interpolation. Sy, “And Jehovah struck down among the people five thousand and seventy men”; the Arabic agrees. TJ, “And he struck down seventy men among the older men of the people, and fifty thousand among the congregation”; LXX, “And he struck down seventy men among them, and fifty thousand of the men”; Josephus (Jewish Antiquities, Book VI, chapter 1, ¶4) mentions only 70 men as killed and omits any reference to 50,000.
====

[[v9-6-20]]

^<<v9-6-20,20>>^ Further, the men of Beth-sheʹmesh said: “Who will be able to stand before Jehovah this holy God, and to whom will he withdraw from off us?”

[[v9-6-21]]

^<<v9-6-21,21>>^ Finally they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirʹi·ath-jeʹa·rim, saying: “The Phi·lisʹtines have returned the ark of Jehovah. Come down. Take it up to yourselves.”
