. “It . . . and all the wives themselves will give.” Hiʼ Wekhol-Han·na·shimʹ Yit·tenuʹ (Heb.) appears to be a reverse acrostic of the Tetragrammaton, יהוה (YHWH). Three ancient Heb. mss are known that give the letters of the divine name here in acrostic in majuscule letters, as follows: תנוי נשיםהכל־ו יאה. This is the first of four such acrostics of the name “Jehovah,” and the Masorah in a ru­bric, or in red letters, calls attention to this.
