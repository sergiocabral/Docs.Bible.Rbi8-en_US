=== Ecclesiastes, 9
// Rbi8 1984, Rbi8 - New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures—With References

[[v21-9-1]]

^<<v21-9-1,1>>^ For I took all this to my heart, even to search out all this, that the righteous ones and the wise ones and their works are in the hand of the &#91;true&#93; God. Mankind are not aware of either the love or the hate that were all prior to them.

[[v21-9-2]]

^<<v21-9-2,2>>^ All are the same in what all have. One eventuality there is to the righteous one and the wicked one, the good one and the clean one and the unclean one, and the one sacrificing and the one that is not sacrificing. The good one is the same as the sinner; the one swearing is the same as whoever has been afraid of a sworn oath.

[[v21-9-3]]

^<<v21-9-3,3>>^ This is what is calamitous in all that has been done under the sun, that, because there is one eventuality to all, the heart of the sons of men is also full of bad; and there is madness in their heart during their lifetime, and after it—to the dead ones!

[[v21-9-4]]

^<<v21-9-4,4>>^ For as respects whoever is joined^&#42;1^ to all the living there exists confidence, because a live dog is better off than a dead lion.

[[v21-9-10]]

[[v21-9-11]]

^<<v21-9-11,11>>^ I returned to see^&#42;1^ under the sun that the swift do not have the race, nor the mighty ones the battle, nor do the wise also have the food,^&#42;2^ nor do the understanding ones also have the riches, nor do even those having knowledge have the favor; because time and unforeseen occurrence befall them all.^&#42;3^

[[v21-9-12]]

^<<v21-9-12,12>>^ For man also does not know his time. Just like fishes that are being taken in an evil net, and like birds that are being taken in a trap, so the sons of men themselves are being ensnared at a calamitous time, when it falls upon them suddenly.
