^<<v10-13-1,1>>^ And it came about after such things that Abʹsa·lom the son of David had a beautiful sister whose name was Taʹmar, and Amʹnon the son of David fell in love with her.

[[v10-13-2]]

^<<v10-13-2,2>>^ And it was so distressing to Amʹnon that he felt sick on account of Taʹmar his sister, because she was a virgin, and it was difficult in the eyes of Amʹnon to do anything at all to her.

[[v10-13-3]]

^<<v10-13-3,3>>^ Now Amʹnon had a companion whose name was Je·honʹa·dab,^&#42;1^ the son of Shimʹe·ah, David’s brother; and Je·honʹa·dab was a very wise man.

[[v10-13-5]]

^<<v10-13-5,5>>^ Upon that Je·honʹa·dab said to him: “Lie down on your bed and play sick. And your father will certainly come to see you, and you must say to him, ‘Please, let Taʹmar my sister come in and give me bread as a patient, and she will have to make the bread of consolation under my eyes in order that I may see it, and I shall have to eat from her hand.’”

[[v10-13-6]]

^<<v10-13-6,6>>^ Accordingly Amʹnon lay down and played sick, and so the king came in to see him. Then Amʹnon said to the king: “Please, let Taʹmar my sister come in and bake two heart-shaped cakes under my eyes, that I may take bread as a patient from her hand.”

[[v10-13-7]]

[[v10-13-13]]

^<<v10-13-13,13>>^ And I—where shall I cause my reproach to go? And you—you will become like one of the senseless men in Israel. And now speak, please, to the king; for he will not withhold me from you.”

^<<v10-13-16,16>>^ At this she said to him: “No, my brother; for^&#42;1^ this badness in sending me away is greater than the other that you have done with me!” And he did not consent to listen to her.

[[v10-13-22]]

^<<v10-13-26,26>>^ Finally Abʹsa·lom said: “If not &#91;you&#93;, let Amʹnon my brother go with us, please.” At this the king said to him: “Why should he go with you?”

[[v10-13-29]]

^<<v10-13-29,29>>^ And Abʹsa·lom’s attendants proceeded to do to Amʹnon just as Abʹsa·lom had commanded; and all the other sons of the king began to rise up and mount each one his mule^&#42;1^ and take to flight.

[[v10-13-33]]

^<<v10-13-33,33>>^ And now do not let my lord the king take to his heart the word, saying, ‘All the king’s sons themselves have died’; but it is Amʹnon alone that has died.”
