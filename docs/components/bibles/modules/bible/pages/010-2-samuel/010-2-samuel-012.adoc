[[v10-12-1]]

^<<v10-12-1,1>>^ And Jehovah proceeded to send Nathan to David. So he came in to him and said to him: “There were two men that happened to be in one city, the one rich and the other of little means.

[[v10-12-2]]

^<<v10-12-2,2>>^ The rich man happened to have very many sheep and cattle;

[[v10-12-3]]

^<<v10-12-3,3>>^ but the man of little means had nothing but one female lamb, a small one, that he had bought. And he was preserving it alive, and it was growing up with him and with his sons, all together. From his morsel it would eat, and from his cup it would drink, and in his bosom it would lie, and it came to be as a daughter to him.

[[v10-12-4]]

^<<v10-12-4,4>>^ After a while a visitor came to the rich man, but he spared taking some from his own sheep and his own cattle to get such ready for the traveler that had come in to him. So he took the female lamb of the man of little means and got it ready for the man that had come in to him.”

[[v10-12-5]]

^<<v10-12-5,5>>^ At this David’s anger grew very hot against the man, so that he said to Nathan: “As Jehovah is living, the man doing this deserves to die!^&#42;1^

[[v10-12-8]]

^<<v10-12-8,8>>^ And I was willing to give you the house of your lord and the wives of your lord into your bosom, and to give you the house^&#42;1^ of Israel and of Judah. And if it were not enough, I was willing to add to you things like these as well as other things.

[[v10-12-9]]

^<<v10-12-9,9>>^ Why did you despise the word of Jehovah by doing what is bad in his eyes? U·riʹah the Hitʹtite you struck down with the sword, and his wife you took as your wife, and him you killed by the sword of the sons of Amʹmon.

[[v10-12-10]]

^<<v10-12-10,10>>^ And now a sword will not depart from your own house to time indefinite, as a consequence of the fact that you despised me so that you took the wife of U·riʹah the Hitʹtite to become your wife.’

[[v10-12-11]]

^<<v10-12-11,11>>^ This is what Jehovah has said, ‘Here I am raising up against you calamity out of your own house; and I will take your wives under your own eyes and give them to your fellowman, and he will certainly lie down with your wives under the eyes of this sun.

[[v10-12-12]]

[[v10-12-14]]

^<<v10-12-14,14>>^ Notwithstanding this, because you have unquestionably treated Jehovah with disrespect^&#42;1^ by this thing, also the son himself, just born to you, will positively die.”

^<<v10-12-15,15>>^ Then Nathan went to his own house.

[[v10-12-17]]

^<<v10-12-17,17>>^ So the older men of his house stood up over him to raise him up from the earth, but he did not consent and did not take bread in company with them.

[[v10-12-18]]

^<<v10-12-18,18>>^ And it came about on the seventh day that the child gradually died. And the servants of David were afraid to tell him that the child had died; for they said: “Look! While the child continued alive we did speak to him, and he did not listen to our voice; so how can we say to him, ‘The child has died’? Then he will certainly do something bad.”

[[v10-12-19]]

^<<v10-12-19,19>>^ When David got to see that his servants were whispering together, David began to discern that the child had died. So David said to his servants: “Has the child died?” To this they said: “He has died.”

[[v10-12-20]]

^<<v10-12-20,20>>^ Then David got up from the earth and washed and rubbed himself with oil and changed his mantles and came to the house of Jehovah and prostrated himself; after which he came into his own house and asked, and they promptly set bread before him and he began to eat.

[[v10-12-21]]

^<<v10-12-21,21>>^ Consequently his servants said to him: “What does this thing mean that you have done? For the sake of the child while alive you fasted and kept weeping; and just as soon as the child had died you got up and began to eat bread.”

[[v10-12-22]]

^<<v10-12-22,22>>^ To this he said: “While the child was yet alive I did fast and I kept weeping, because I said to myself, ‘Who is there knowing whether Jehovah may show me favor, and the child will certainly live?’

[[v10-12-23]]

^<<v10-12-23,23>>^ Now that he has died, why is it I am fasting? Am I able to bring him back again? I am going to him, but, as for him, he will not return to me.”
