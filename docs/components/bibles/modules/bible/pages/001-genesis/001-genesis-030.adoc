[[v1-30-32]]

^<<v1-30-32,32>>^ I will pass among your whole flock today. You set aside from there every sheep speckled and with color patches, and every dark-brown sheep among the young rams and any color-patched and speckled one among the she-goats. Hereafter such must be my wages.

[[v1-30-33]]

^<<v1-30-33,33>>^ And my right-doing must answer for me on whatever future day you may come to look over my wages; every one that is not speckled and color-patched among the she-goats and dark brown among the young rams is something stolen if it is with me.”

^<<v1-30-36,36>>^ After that he set a distance of three days’ journey between himself and Jacob, and Jacob was shepherding the flocks of Laʹban that remained over.

[[v1-30-37]]

^<<v1-30-37,37>>^ Then Jacob took for his use staffs^&#42;1^ still moist of the storax tree and of the almond tree and of the plane tree and peeled in them white peeled spots by laying bare white places which were upon the staffs.

[NOTE]
====
. “They might conceive,” Vg.
====

[[v1-30-39]]

^<<v1-30-39,39>>^ Consequently the flocks would get in heat before the staffs, and the flocks would produce striped, speckled and color-patched ones.

[[v1-30-40]]

^<<v1-30-40,40>>^ And Jacob separated the young rams and then turned the faces of the flocks to the striped ones and all the dark-brown ones among the flocks of Laʹban. Then he set his own droves by themselves and did not set them by the flocks of Laʹban.

[[v1-30-41]]

^<<v1-30-41,41>>^ And it always occurred that whenever the robust flocks would get in heat, Jacob would locate the staffs in the gutters before the eyes of the flocks, that they might get in heat by the staffs.

[[v1-30-42]]

[[v1-30-43]]

^<<v1-30-43,43>>^ And the man went on increasing more and more, and great flocks and maidservants and menservants and camels and asses came to be his.
