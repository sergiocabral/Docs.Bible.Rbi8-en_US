^<<v62-2-1,1>>^ My little children, I am writing YOU these things that YOU may not commit a sin.^&#42;1^ And yet, if anyone does commit a sin, we have a helper^&#42;2^ with the Father, Jesus Christ, a righteous one.

[NOTE]
====
. “You may . . . commit a sin.” Gr., ha·marʹte·te, a verb in the aorist subjunctive. According to A Grammar of New Testament Greek, by James H. Moulton, Vol. I, 1908, p. 109, “the Aorist has a ‘punctiliar’ action, that is, it regards action as a point: it represents the point of entrance . . . or that of completion . . . or it looks at a whole action simply as having occurred, without distinguishing any steps in its progress.”
. Lit., “paraclete.” Gr., pa·raʹkle·ton.
