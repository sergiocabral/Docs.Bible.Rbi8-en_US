[[v3-13-57]]

^<<v3-13-57,57>>^ However, if it still appears in the garment or in the warp or in the woof or in any article of skin, it is breaking out. You should burn in the fire whatever it is in which the plague is.

[[v3-13-58]]

^<<v3-13-58,58>>^ As for the garment or the warp or the woof or any article of skin that you may wash, when the plague has disappeared from them, it must then be washed a second time; and it must be clean.
