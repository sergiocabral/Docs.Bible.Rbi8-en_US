. Nehemiah completes the evidence that the literal city of Jerusalem had 12 gates, even as the heavenly holy city described by John the apostle has 12 gates​—⁠three facing each of the four directions​—⁠as recorded in Re 21:12, 13. Earthly Jerusalem’s 12 gates are listed in counterclockwise order from where Nehemiah started his inspection tour. SOUTHERN SECTION: Valley Gate (2:13), Gate of the Ash-heaps (2:13) and Fountain Gate (2:14); EASTERN SECTION: Water Gate (3:26), Horse Gate (3:28) and Inspection Gate (3:31); NORTHERN SECTION: Gate of the Guard (12:39), Sheep Gate (3:32) and Fish Gate (3:3); WESTERN SECTION: Gate of the Old [City] (3:6), Gate of Ephraim (12:39) and Corner Gate (2Ch 25:23; Zec 14:10).

^<<v16-13-20,20>>^ Consequently the traders and the sellers of every sort of merchandise spent the night outside Jerusalem once and a second time.

[[v16-13-21]]

^<<v16-13-21,21>>^ Then I proceeded to bear witness against them and say to them: “Why are YOU spending the night in front of the wall? If YOU do it again, a hand I shall lay on YOU.” From that time on they did not come on the sabbath.

[[v16-13-22]]

^<<v16-13-22,22>>^ And I went on to say to the Levites that they should be regularly purifying themselves and coming in, keeping guard of the gates to sanctify^&#42;1^ the sabbath day. This, also, do remember to my account, O my God, and do feel sorry for me according to the abundance of your loving-kindness.

[[v16-13-26]]

^<<v16-13-26,26>>^ Was it not because of these that Solʹo·mon the king of Israel sinned? And among the many nations there proved to be no king like him; and loved of his God he happened to be, so that God constituted him king over all Israel. Even him the foreign wives caused to sin.

[[v16-13-27]]

^<<v16-13-27,27>>^ And is it not something unheard of for YOU to commit all this great badness in acting unfaithfully against our God by giving a dwelling to foreign wives?”

^<<v16-13-31,31>>^ even for the supply^&#42;1^ of the wood at appointed times and for the first ripe fruits.
Do remember me, O my God, for good.
