^<<v43-4-10,10>>^ In answer Jesus said to her: “If you had known the free gift of God and who it is that says to you, ‘Give me a drink,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.”

[[v43-4-11]]

^<<v43-4-11,11>>^ She said to him: “Sir, you have not even a bucket for drawing water, and the well is deep. From what source, therefore, do you have this living water?

[[v43-4-22]]

[[v43-4-23]]

^<<v43-4-23,23>>^ Nevertheless, the hour is coming, and it is now, when the true worshipers will worship the Father with spirit and truth, for, indeed, the Father is looking for suchlike ones to worship him.

[[v43-4-27]]

^<<v43-4-27,27>>^ Now at this point his disciples arrived, and they began to wonder because he was speaking with a woman. Of course, no one said: “What are you looking for?” or, “Why do you talk with her?”

[[v43-4-28]]

^<<v43-4-28,28>>^ The woman, therefore, left her water jar and went off into the city and told the men:

[[v43-4-29]]

^<<v43-4-29,29>>^ “Come here, see a man that told me all the things I did. This is not perhaps the Christ, is it?”

[[v43-4-30]]

^<<v43-4-30,30>>^ They went out of the city and began coming to him.

[[v43-4-31]]

^<<v43-4-31,31>>^ Meanwhile the disciples were urging him, saying: “Rabbi, eat.”

[[v43-4-32]]

^<<v43-4-32,32>>^ But he said to them: “I have food to eat of which YOU do not know.”

[[v43-4-33]]

^<<v43-4-33,33>>^ Therefore the disciples began saying to one another: “No one has brought him anything to eat, has he?”

[[v43-4-34]]

^<<v43-4-34,34>>^ Jesus said to them: “My food is for me to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work.

[[v43-4-35]]

^<<v43-4-35,35>>^ Do YOU not say that there are yet four months before the harvest comes? Look! I say to YOU: Lift up YOUR eyes and view the fields, that they are white for harvesting. Already

[[v43-4-36]]

^<<v43-4-36,36>>^ the reaper is receiving wages and gathering fruit for everlasting life, so that the sower and the reaper may rejoice together.

[[v43-4-37]]

^<<v43-4-37,37>>^ In this respect, indeed, the saying is true, One is the sower and another the reaper.

[[v43-4-38]]

^<<v43-4-38,38>>^ I dispatched YOU to reap what YOU have spent no labor on. Others have labored, and YOU have entered into the benefit of their labor.”

[[v43-4-39]]

^<<v43-4-39,39>>^ Now many of the Sa·marʹi·tans out of that city put faith in him on account of the word of the woman who said in witness: “He told me all the things I did.”

[[v43-4-40]]

^<<v43-4-40,40>>^ Therefore when the Sa·marʹi·tans came to him, they began asking him to stay with them; and he stayed there two days.

[[v43-4-41]]

^<<v43-4-41,41>>^ Consequently many more believed on account of what he said,

[[v43-4-42]]

^<<v43-4-42,42>>^ and they began to say to the woman: “We do not believe any longer on account of your talk; for we have heard for ourselves and we know that this man is for a certainty the savior of the world.”

[[v43-4-43]]

^<<v43-4-43,43>>^ After the two days he left there for Galʹi·lee.

[[v43-4-44]]

^<<v43-4-44,44>>^ Jesus himself, however, bore witness that in his own homeland a prophet has no honor.

[[v43-4-45]]

^<<v43-4-45,45>>^ When, therefore, he arrived in Galʹi·lee, the Gal·i·leʹans received him, because they had seen all the things he did in Jerusalem at the festival, for they also had gone to the festival.

[[v43-4-46]]

^<<v43-4-46,46>>^ Accordingly he came again to Caʹna of Galʹi·lee, where he had turned the water into wine. Now there was a certain attendant of the king whose son was sick in Ca·perʹna·um.

[[v43-4-47]]

^<<v43-4-47,47>>^ When this man heard that Jesus had come out of Ju·deʹa into Galʹi·lee, he went off to him and began asking him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of dying.

[[v43-4-48]]

^<<v43-4-48,48>>^ However, Jesus said to him: “Unless YOU people see signs and wonders, YOU will by no means believe.”

[[v43-4-49]]

^<<v43-4-49,49>>^ The attendant of the king said to him: “Lord,^&#42;1^ come down before my young child dies.”

[[v43-4-51]]

^<<v43-4-51,51>>^ But already while he was on his way down his slaves met him to say that his boy was living.

[[v43-4-52]]

^<<v43-4-52,52>>^ Therefore he began to inquire of them the hour in which he got better in health. Accordingly they said to him: “Yesterday at the seventh hour^&#42;1^ the fever left him.”

[[v43-4-53]]

^<<v43-4-53,53>>^ Therefore the father knew it was in the very hour that Jesus said to him: “Your son lives.” And he and his whole household believed.

[[v43-4-54]]

^<<v43-4-54,54>>^ Again this was the second sign Jesus performed when he came out of Ju·deʹa into Galʹi·lee.
